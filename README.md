## Project Progress  
Currently, HeartSync's development is approximately 10% complete. We are continuously refining the platform's functionality and performance to deliver an even better experience for our users.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend  
- **[Angular 19](https://angular.io/)**: We leverage the latest version of Angular to ensure the platform's high performance and stability.  
- **[Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)**: This Material Design component library provides a visually appealing and consistent user interface experience.  
- **[Formly](https://formly.dev/)**: A powerful form library that enables dynamic form generation and complex form logic.

### Backend  
- **[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)**: A robust Node.js framework that offers efficient and scalable backend services.  
- **[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)**: Used for authentication and authorization to ensure the platform's security.  
- **[MinIO](https://min.io/)**: A high-performance distributed object storage solution for storing application static resources and files.

### Database  
- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)**: A powerful open-source relational database that supports complex data queries and transaction processing.

## Platform Features

### Multi-Application Building  
HeartSync allows users to create and manage multiple applications, each independently configurable and runnable. This feature enables users to quickly build applications tailored to their specific needs.

### Feature-Rich Dashboard  
The application's menu page is designed as a customizable dashboard. Users can drag and drop various components to create a personalized dashboard. The available components include:  
- **Custom Code Pages**: Users can write custom code to implement complex business logic.  
- **Visual Configuration for Online Charts**: A variety of chart types are available, allowing users to visually configure data visualizations.  
- **3D Maps**: Integration of 3D map components for geographic information visualization.  
- **Forms**: Robust form functionality with support for various form controls and complex logic.  
- **Lists**: For displaying data lists with features like pagination and sorting.  
- **Details**: Displays detailed information with customizable layouts and styling.

### Visual Configuration and Code Generation  
HeartSync not only supports visual configuration but also generates code from these configurations. Users can further extend their applications by modifying the generated code.

### Flexible Data Binding  
The platform supports multiple data binding modes. Users can choose to directly bind form fields to database table fields or use custom logic during submission. This flexibility caters to a wide range of user needs.

### Multiple Layout Options  
HeartSync offers three layout options—grid, Flex, and absolute positioning—allowing users to create personalized application interfaces based on their preferences and requirements.

### Form Reusability  
Users can save frequently used forms as templates and reuse them across different applications, significantly improving development efficiency.

## Platform Advantages

### Efficient Development  
By adopting a low-code approach, HeartSync enables users to build applications quickly, reducing development time and boosting efficiency.

### Strong Flexibility  
With features like multiple data binding modes, layout options, and form reusability, HeartSync adapts to various complex business scenarios and meets the diverse needs of users.

### High Scalability  
Built on a robust technology stack, HeartSync is highly scalable. Users can perform secondary development and functional expansion according to their specific requirements.

### Security and Reliability  
Using Keycloak for authentication and authorization ensures platform security. The backend, powered by NestJS, guarantees the stability and reliability of the platform.

### User-Friendly  
HeartSync provides a visual configuration interface, allowing users to build and configure applications with minimal coding. Additionally, comprehensive documentation and examples help users get started quickly.

## Future Outlook  
Going forward, HeartSync will continue to enhance and optimize its features. We plan to introduce the following technologies:  
- **AI Integration**: To provide intelligent code generation and optimization suggestions, further improving development efficiency.  
- **Serverless Architecture**: To reduce operational costs and enhance platform scalability.  
- **Expanded Integration Options**: Supporting more third-party services and API integrations to enrich the platform's functionality and use cases.
